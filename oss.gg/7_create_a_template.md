**Side Quest**: Create a template of using some framework or language to build an API and protect it with Ghost

**Requirements**:

- No duplicates, please check [ghost.com/templates](https://www.ghost.com/templates) first
- Must be open source, either committed to [github.com/getghost/examples](https://github.com/getghost/examples) or to your own GitHub account.
- Must be MIT licensed
- Must have a README.md including a quickstart for how to run your example.

**Points**: 750 points

**Proof**: Open a PR including the link to your repository.
