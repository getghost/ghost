## 2. Choose how you want to use Ghost

As soon as you create your account you will be asked to choose how you want to use Ghost. Your options are:

- **API Keys**: This is used for protecting your public API.
- **Ratelimiting**: This is global low latency ratelimiting for your application.

> You can of course use both, but for this choose Ratelimiting.
