You'll need to authenticate your requests to access some of the endpoints in the Ghost API. In this guide, we'll look at how authentication works.

## Bearer Token

When requesting resources, you will need your root key â€” you will find it in the [Dashboard](https://app.ghost.com/settings/root-keys). Here's how to add the root key to the request header using cURL:

```bash
curl https://api.ghost.dev/v1/... \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ghost_xxx"
```

Always keep your root key safe and reset it if you suspect it has been compromised.
