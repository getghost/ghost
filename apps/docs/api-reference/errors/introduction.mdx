The Ghost API returns machine readable error codes to quickly identify the type of error as well as link to the docs and a `requestId`. Please always include the `requestId` in your error report.


```json
{
  error: {
    code: "UNAUTHORIZED",
    message: "We were unable to authorize your request. Either your key was missing, malformed or does not have the required permissions.",
    docs: "https://ghost.api/docs/api-reference/errors/code/BAD_REQUEST",
    requestId: "req_1234567890"
  }
}

```


If you can't debug something on your own or think there is a bug, please get in touch with us on [Discord](https://ghost.com/discord) or [Email](mailto:support@ghost.dev) and provide the full error response.
