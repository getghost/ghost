[Elixir SDK](https://github.com/glamboyosa/ghost-elixir-sdk) for interacting with the platform programatically.

## Installation

The package can be installed from Hex PM by adding `ghost_elixir_sdk` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

> Note: This project uses Elixir version `1.13`.

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ghost_elixir_sdk, "~> 0.2.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Start the GenServer

In order to start this package we can either start it under a supervision tree (most common).

The GenServer takes a map with two properties.

- token: Your [Ghost](https://ghost.com) root key used to make requests. You can create one [here](https://app.ghost.com/settings/root-keys) **required**
- base_url: The base URL endpoint you will be hitting i.e. `https://api.ghost.dev/v1/keys` (optional).

```elixir
 children = [
      {GhostElixirSdk, %{token: "yourghostrootkey"}}
    ]


# Now we start the supervisor with the children and a strategy
{:ok, pid} = Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)

# After started, we can query the supervisor for information
Supervisor.count_children(pid)
#=> %{active: 1, specs: 1, supervisors: 0, workers: 1}
```

You can also call the `start_link` function instead.

```elixir
{:ok, _pid} = GhostElixirSdk.start_link(%{token: "yourghostrootkey", base_url: "https://api.ghost.dev/v1/keys"})
```
