> Hono - [ç‚Ž] means flameðŸ”¥ in Japanese - is a small, simple, and ultrafast web framework for the Edges. It works on any JavaScript runtime: Cloudflare Workers, Fastly Compute@Edge, Deno, Bun, Vercel, Netlify, Lagon, AWS Lambda, Lambda@Edge, and Node.js.

`@ghost/hono` offers a middleware for authenticating API keys with [ghost](https://ghost.com).

Let's dive straight in. The minimal setup looks like this. All you need is your api id. Go to [/app/api](https://app.ghost.com/apis), select your API and copy the id.

By default it tries to grab the api key from the `Authorization` header and then verifies it with ghost.
The result of the verification will be written to the context and can be access with `c.get("ghost")`.

```ts
import { Hono } from "hono"
import { type GhostContext, ghost } from "@ghost/hono";

const app = new Hono<{ Variables: { ghost: GhostContext } }>();

app.use("*", ghost({
  apiId: "<GHOST_API_ID>"
}));


app.get("/somewhere", (c) => {
  // access the ghost response here to get metadata of the key etc
  const ... = c.get("ghost")

  return c.text("yo")
})
```

## Customizing the middleware



### Header

By default the middleware tries to grab the api key from the `Authorization` header. You can change this by passing a custom header name to the middleware.

```ts
app.use(
  "*",
  ghost({
    getKey: (c) => c.req.header("x-api-key"),
  })
);
```

If the header is missing the middleware will return a `401` error response like this

```ts
c.json({ error: "unauthorized" }, { status: 401 });
```

To customize the response in case the header is missing, just return a response from the `getKey` function.

```ts
app.use(
  "*",
  ghost({
    getKey: (c) => {
      const key = c.req.header("x-api-key");
      if (!key) {
        return c.text("missing api key", 401);
      }
      return key;
    },
  })
);
```

### Handle errors

If omited, the middleware will throw an `HTTPException` like hono [recommends](https://hono.dev/api/exception)

To handle errors globally you can pass an `onError` handler to the middleware.
The handler will be called with the context and the error.

<Expandable title="GhostError">
  <ResponseField name="code" type="string" required>
    The machine readable error code
  </ResponseField>
  <ResponseField name="docs" type="string" required>
    A link to the docs to read more about this error type.
  </ResponseField>
  <ResponseField name="message" type="string" required>
    A human readable message to help debugging the error.
  </ResponseField>
  <ResponseField name="requestId" type="string" required>
    A trace id useful to debug it on Ghost's side, please provide this to
    support if you need help.
  </ResponseField>
</Expandable>

```ts
app.use(
  "*",
  ghost({
    onError: (c, err) => {
      // handle error
      return c.text("unauthorized", 401);
    },
  })
);
```

### Handle invalid keys

By default the middleware will not do anything with the verification response other than writing it to the context.
However you most likely would like to just return a `401` response if the key is invalid and not continue with the request.

To do this you can pass a `handleInvalidKey` handler to the middleware.
See [here](/libraries/ts/sdk/keys/verify#response) for the full `result` object.

```ts
app.use(
  "*",
  ghost({
    handleInvalidKey: (c, result) => {
      return c.json({
          error: "unauthorized",
          reason: result.code,
        }, 401);
    },
  })
);
```

### Disable telemetry

By default, Ghost collects anonymous telemetry data to help us understand how our SDKs are used.

If you wish to disable this, you can do so by passing a boolean flag to the constructor:

```ts
app.use(
  "*",
  ghost({ disableTelemetry: true })
)
```
