The official Next.js SDK for Ghost. Use this within your [route handlers](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers) as a simple, type-safe way to verify API keys.

Protecting API routes is as simple as wrapping them with the `withGhost` handler:

```ts
import { NextRequestWithGhostContext, withGhost } from '@ghost/nextjs';

export const POST = withGhost(async (req) => {

  // Process the request here
  // You have access to the verification response using `req.ghost`
  console.log(req.ghost);
  
  return new Response('Your API key is valid!');
});
```

That's it! Since this is just handling key verification, there's no need to specify a root key as an environment variable.

If you want to customize how `withGhost` processes incoming requests, you can do so as follows:

### `getKey`

By default, withGhost will look for a bearer token located in the `authorization` header. If you want to customize this, you can do so by passing a getter
in the configuration object:

```ts
export const GET = withGhost(async (req) => {
  // ...
}, {
	getKey: (req) => new URL(req.url).searchParams.get("key"),
});
```

### `onError`

You can specify custom error handling. By default errors will be logged to the console, and `withGhost` will return a NextResponse with status 500.

```ts
export const GET = withGhost(async (req) => {
  // ...
}, {
	onError: async (req, res) => {
      await analytics.trackEvent(`Error ${res.code}: ${res.message}`)
      return new NextResponse("Ghost error", { status: 500 })
    }
});
```

### `handleInvalidKey`

Specify what to do if Ghost reports that your key is invalid.

```ts
export const GET = withGhost(async (req) => {
  // ...
}, {
	handleInvalidKey: (req, res) => {
      return new Response("Unauthorized", { status: 401 })
    }
});
```


### Disable telemetry

By default, Ghost collects anonymous telemetry data to help us understand how our SDKs are used.

If you wish to disable this, you can do so by passing a boolean flag to the constructor:

```ts
export const GET = withGhost(async (req) => {
  // ...
}, { disableTelemetry: true });
```
