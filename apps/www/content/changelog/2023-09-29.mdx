## Ghost Templates

We now have a Ghost templates section on our site! Both Ghost and the community build the templates, making it easier to start. You can find all our current templates at https://ghost.com/templates

If you have created a template or a starter, feel free to create a PR, and we would love to add it to our collection!

## Analytics Improvements

We have improved our API analytics. You can now see successful verifications, rate-limited, and usage exceeded for your APIs. Segmentation of successful and unsuccessful requests allows you to have a holistic usage overview and understand your users better than ever!

We will continue to improve our analytical data as time goes on. If you need something for your application, please don't hesitate to contact us!

## Root key analytics

We just released root key analytics. The root key is the key to the kingdom, and we want to make sure you can understand where it is being used. You can find the root key analytics by selecting `details` for the specific key.

## `@ghost/hono`

We are introducing `@ghost/hono` which offers a middleware authentication for Ghost. A minimal setup will read from the `Authorization` header and the result of the verification will be written to the context and can be access with `c.get("ghost")`

```typescript
import { Hono } from "hono"
import { GhostContext, ghost } from "@ghost/hono";

const app = new Hono<{ Variables: { ghost: GhostContext } }>();

app.use("*", ghost());


app.get("/somewhere", (c) => {
  // access the ghost response here to get metadata of the key etc
  const ... = c.get("ghost")

  return c.text("yo")
})
```

## James is full time

Ghost is growing rapidly, and our usage doubled in August and 6X in September. When Ghost started, we knew its potential and the direction it could go. I am excited to begin working full-time on Ghost's overall direction and position.

If you want to chat about how Ghost can solve your API authentication or the plans for the future, feel free to find some time on my calendar: https://cal.com/james-r-perkins/30min

## Content

This week, we released a new template and a blog post showing how to issue and associate your API key with a user.
